        <b>Evan Matthews</b> is an audio engineer, computer scientist and music composer, with an MS in Computer Science and a BS in Computer Science + Music from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
        His research focuses on audio computing and AI/ML, more specifically the improvement of AI audio generation and lossless translation between sheet music and audio. 
        He is an alum of the CS Audio Lab, under thesis advising from <a href="https://paris.cs.illinois.edu">Paris Smaragdis</a> and with additional guidance from <a href="https://minjekim.com">Minje Kim</a>.

        Evan picked up interests in music when he began learning to play piano and clarinet at age 12. 
        In high school, he participated in the MTHS Wind Ensemble and tried music composition for the first time.
        He took second place in the 2018 and 2019 ILMEA Composition Tracks for his solo piano works, leading him to study music composition and computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

        Evan continued composing as an undergraduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 
        where he delved into experimental and computer music, participated in the UIUC Electronic Music Studios (EMS), 
        and studied under <a href="https://stephenandrewtaylor.net">Stephen Andrew Taylor</a>, <a href="https://music.illinois.edu/people/profiles/reynold-tharp/">Reynold Tharp</a>, <a href="https://music.illinois.edu/people/profiles/heinrich-taube/">Heinrich Taube</a>, and <a href="http://www.elifieldsteel.com">Eli Fieldsteel</a>. 
        
        As a graduate student, his focus shifted to research on AI audio generation and text prompt recaptioning. He also gained experience taking computer vision, text mining and AI ethics courses.

        <p>
            Evan is currently residing in Bloomington, Illinois, where he is open to roles in software engineering, AI/ML, and data analytics.
