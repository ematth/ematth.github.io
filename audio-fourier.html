        <h2>Fourier Transform</h2>
        <p><b>Date:</b> 2023-07-04</p>
        
        <p>The Fourier Transform is a transformation of a time-series function which returns a respective frequency-series function, or an equivalent function who takes a frequency <i>f</i> as an input rather than a time <i>t</i></p>
        
        <p>f_hat(ξ) = ∫ f(t) e<sup>-i2πξt</sup> dt</p>
        
        <p>where f(t) is the original function for our sound in terms of time <i>t</i>, and f_hat(ξ) is an equivalent function in terms of frequency ξ. In essence, this function takes in a frequency and determines that frequency's <i>intensity</i> or usage in a sound across all time values <i>t</i> in f(t)- hence why we're integrating with respect to time. For example, if we have a sound and want to know if the frequency A4 = 440 Hz was used, we can compute f_hat(440) to figure out whether or not there's a "peak" for this frequency, (indicating that it is exists in our sound.)</p>
        
        <p>However, this formula is much more complicated than a summation over time series, and we'll need to understand how e<sup>-i2πξt</sup> and the complex plane plays into the Fourier Transform.</p>
        
        <p>Looking at only the imaginary term of e<sup>-i2πξt</sup>, we can break it up into several components: e<sup>it</sup> is derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula">Euler's Formula</a>, where <i>t</i> represents an angle on a unit circle. Using e<sup>-it</sup> flips the direction in which we traverse the circle as <i>t</i> approaches a large positive value. 2π is a constraint for graphing all values of <i>t</i> onto <i>complete rotations</i> of the unit circle. It's best to think of this portion as a way of mapping any function f(t) onto the unit circle. Finally, by integrating f(t) e<sup>-i2πξt</sup> for all values of <i>t</i>, we get a function defining the intensity of a certain frequency ξ in the complex plane over time. This combination of steps allows us to compute a function for any frequency ξ to determine if a certain frequency is present in a sound.</p>

        <h3>Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)</h3>
        
        <p>With the basics of the Fourier Transform understood, we can jump into a more practical uses of the fourier transform for audio processing. The above formula works on infinite, continuous time signals, but in a more applicable sense, we'd like to use this formula on finite, <i>discrete</i> time signals, (i.e. a set number of samples, with no information in between samples.) For that, we have the <b>Discrete Fourier Transform</b>, or <b>DFT</b>:</p>
        
        <p>X_k = ∑ X_n e<sup>-i(2πkn/N)</sup></p>
        
        <p>The equation can be described like this: given a frequency <i>k</i>, X_k returns the intensity of that frequency across all samples n∈ N. The logic behind this equation is similar to the continuous Fourier transform, although this transformation will return an estimate for the frequency in the <i>N</i> samples provided.</p>
